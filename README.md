## Inspiration
We were interested in building a calculator. During our brainstorming, we came up with the idea for a retirement calculator which would take into account fees charged by different companies, based on questions frequently asked in 403(b) groups aimed at educators. 

## What it does
The calculators take into account factors such as current age, age of retirement, contribution and the annual return rate to tell the users how much they'll have in their account by the time they retire. 

Another feature is the retirement projection, which estimates the amount needed to support the user's lifestyle based on retirement age and lifespan expectancy.

## How we built it
The factors to be taken into account by the formulas were based on research of how 401(k) and 403(b) contributions work, and how fees are calculated.

For the retirement projection, rather than show how much could be safely withdrawn each month (safe withdrawal rate), we went the opposite direction and calculated the amount needed to be able to support a set monthly withdrawal. 

## Challenges we ran into
The information available often contradicts itself or is simply obfuscating. It was a challenge in and of itself to understand 401(k) and 403(b) through research so it would be possible write down the formulas.

On the navigation department, a challenge that could not be overcome with the time available was the resizing of the fonts. This feature was idealized as incremental changes to font size rather than a set amount.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
### Raissa
I'm proud of being able to make an accessible website to host the calculators. Although the design might not be super creative or groundbreaking, it is easy to navigate.

## What we learned
### Raissa
As this was my first real use of JavaScript on a project, I learned a lot about functions and how to customize solutions that are already available. It was also very helpful to run Lighthouse tests on the website to check for accessibility issues.

## What's next for Capital Hack
### Raissa
With time, I'd reduce the number of CSS and JavaScript files, and have the buttons for font resizing to make incremental adjustments. 
I'd like to research and possibly introduce features such as accomodations for color blindness and dyslexia. I am also interested in making a bilingual website not dependant on external translation APIs.
